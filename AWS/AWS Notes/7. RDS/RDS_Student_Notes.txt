RDS Student Notes:

1. Explain them what is the use case of having databases & type of databases
	sql(rds/mysql) & nosql db's (dynamodb)
	
2. Explain about the structured & un structured data.
3. Start explaining about mysql with the private & public subnetc along with vpc
	1. Create a vpc with pub & private subnets along with routes 
	2. Explain them the architecture of db along with ec2
	
	Commands:
	mysql -u admin -p -P 3306 -h mysingledb.cwqhpz3cgn8j.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
	show databases;
	create database devops;
	use devops;
	create table studentslist(name VARCHAR(30), mobno VARCHAR(20));
	insert into studentslist values("shahan", 7795540416);
	select * from studentslist;

4. Explain in detail about the use of multi AZ & teach them about the vpc with multi private subnets 
	explain about the subnet groups .. 
	
Installing wordpress application 

	sudo yum update -y
	sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2
	sudo yum install -y httpd
	sudo systemctl start httpd
	sudo systemctl enable httpd
	wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
	tar -xzf latest.tar.gz
	sudo cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/
	cd /var/www/html/
	sudo cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php

	Post db installation do the below.

	sudo vi wp-config.php --> add the database details to this file
	sudo chown -R apache /var/www
	sudo chgrp -R apache /var/www
	sudo chmod 775 /var/www
	sudo find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \;
	sudo find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \;
	sudo systemctl restart httpd

Teach them the configuration with the created db bring down the db & show them the use case of AZ 
Note: you while loop for host command .. 

5. Take the snapshot of the existing db & bring a db out of it. 
6. Now modify your application & show them the importance of snapshot
7. Teach them about read replicas.

	Read replicas plays an important role in providing read access for the database. You many be 
	wondered why should we use this ??
	1.	Just imagine we have one application which is dependent on the database, where as that database is
	not getting updated with latest data as there are no changes in the data. If that is the case we can opt for
	the read replicas which plays an important role in giving me the best results.
	2.	Each & every read replica set acts like the individual database, each & every instance have its own FQDN. 
	You can access it individually 
	3.	We can create max of 5 read replicas per database across AZ and across region aswell
	4.	One more benefit out of read replicas is during DR time just imagine the datacentre is down, 
	you are in a need of database instance which need to spin up immediately in such cases you can simply promote the 
	read replicas as database instance. Which will hard to hard takes 60-120 secs to come up.
