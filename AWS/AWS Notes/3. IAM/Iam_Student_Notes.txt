1. User Creation
	- with out policies
	- with policies
	- with multiple policies
	- MFA for individual account
	- users with password & access keys(optional will teach in python)
	- Customizing the userlogin url
2. Group Creation
   - importance of groups (not passwords to login)
   - adding policies to group
   - adding users to the group
   - removing policies to the group
   
Note: Note that a group is not truly an "identity" in IAM because it cannot be identified as a Principal in a permission policy. 
It is simply a way to attach policies to multiple users at one time.

3. Policies
   - inline policies & customer managed policies
   - explain about ARN (Amazon Resource Name)
   - Create our own custom policy and attach it to the user
   - Create s3 buckets (dvs-hyd,dvs-blr) and create customer based polices 

4. Roles

STS --> Security Token Services
Notes:
	Roles don’t have access keys
	Roles don’t used for login in to the console
	They don’t’ have username & password
	They have short time credentials
